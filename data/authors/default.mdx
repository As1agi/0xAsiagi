I’m a university student and a passionate learning enthusiast, deeply interested in cybersecurity, backend development, and building practical tools. I enjoy exploring cryptography, secure systems, and machine learning, always aiming to understand how things work at a deep level.

My focus is on **learning and experimenting**, tackling challenging problems, and gradually turning knowledge into real-world skills. I thrive in areas that combine logic, problem-solving, and creativity, especially when it comes to backend systems and security-focused projects.

Outside of academics and coding, I’m fascinated by technology, hacking challenges, and exploring ways to build tools that are both functional and secure. I approach learning as a continuous journey, and I’m always seeking new opportunities to grow and apply my skills.

If you’re working on anything related to cybersecurity, backend systems, or privacy-focused initiatives, feel free to [reach out](https://forms.gle/xzNLePfdqVGFB9HF6). I’m always open to learning and collaborating.
